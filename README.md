# VeraPrinsen.github.io
I created these Github Pages to be able to access my nerdy resources from anywhere.

## Applications
### [Boardgames](https://veraprinsen.github.io/#/boardgames)
I like to keep track of the boardgames I own. Something I missed on BoardGameGeek was a way to filter on your games based on the number of players and the time you have to play a game. So I though, why not create this myself? This application uses the BGG APIs to get information about the games. Local storage keeps track of the games you've selected previously.

### [Witch of Fern Island](https://veraprinsen.github.io/#/witch-of-fern-island)
The videogame 'Witch of Fern Island' is a game I like a lot. At some point the resources on the wiki and fandom pages were not enough for me. So I created my own custom resources map, in which you can filter on the current season and moon phase you are currently playing in.

### [Game of Life](https://veraprinsen.github.io/#/game-of-life)
In 2017, I had just finished my studies that had nothing to do with software development, but I knew I liked programming from the little bits we had to do during our study and wanted to do more with this. I managed to get into a program that would learn me software development in 1.5 years, but to get in we had to do some tests, one of which was to code the [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). It wasn't so much about the result, but more about how you got there and how you worked together with another candidate. At the end we just finished the first draft of the code just as the time was up, so we didn't get to test it. I managed to get into the program, but was still wondering if the code would work. So immediately after I got home, I tried it again, until it worked. So this is basically one of the firsts application I've created and am very proud of it and the story behind it.
